Code4Brownies is a  software that enables instructors and students share codes (using the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) editor) instantaneously during a lecture or study session.  Code4Brownies is minimal as it is designed to stay out of the way while providing the necessary features for collaborative coding.  Code sharing is achieved through Sublime Text editors on students' and teacher's laptop talking to each other through a server run on the teacher's laptop.

Code4Brownies is designed to support several pedagogical strategies including scaffolding, guided instruction, and differentiated instruction. Active-learning features allow teachers to give virtual brownie points to students, to administer poll, short quizzes, and take attendance.
